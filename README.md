### Web Design & Marketing

I am a web designer, marketer, and WordPress builder.

Over the last few years, I spent a lot of time marketing websites and improve the user experience to increase the sales of small businesses.

And I really love it! Being creative and analytic at the same time. Going crazy playing around with ideas, colors, and shapes. And then making it fit in with the message and the goals of the company is just so rewarding – and so much fun.

### WordPress & Coding & Design

I discovered WordPress in 2012 when I wanted to start a blog.

Equally fascinated and irritated because I used to program everything from scratch, I started playing around with WordPress, tested plugins and themes, and found ways to act out my love for individuality and at the same time being able to build websites a lot faster and more compatible.

Today, after nearly 10 years of WordPress, my biggest fun is to tweak existing themes and be able to build distinct designs fast and easily.

One of my hobbies is to build nice images just with CSS. If you are interested you can find some explanations on my blog.

### 
Web App Security



Although designing websites is my dream job, I’ve always been interested in the “hacker scene”.

There was always a fascination with tweaking systems and making them do things they were usually not built to do.

I love playing around with new WordPress themes and find new uses for functions to make the looks more unique and individual.

Reading more and more about “Hacking” and “Security”, I started to realize that Web Security is too often a neglected topic, especially with small businesses.

In this day and age, I think that can be a dangerous thing. Many small businesses depend on their online presence and, having their website hacked or online accounts compromised and messed with can have serious consequences.

So I started looking into the security side of things and fell down the rabbit hole. Now, learning more about these topics and playing “hacking games” is a major part of my spare time.
